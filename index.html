                        <p>Retro 1010! is a Tetris like inspired by the quite famouse game "1010!".
                           You need to place pieces of diferent sizes and shapes on a 10 by 10 board,
                           and try to always have enough places to do so.
                           You earn points when placing a piece, or supressing a line by filling up an entire row or column.
                           Finished during my free time in high school, I spent a good time developing alone all parts of the game,
                           including the sound system and the texture design.</p>

                           The player's goal is, at the end of the predefine number of rounds, to have more pieces than his oponent on the board.
