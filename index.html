                        <p>Made in a 3-person team with the theme: "Stronger Together", Divided Soul is a 2D puzzle game in cooperation.
                           You play two split souls on the same keyboard which have to merge together to become complete (and complete the level!).
                           We created 2 levels and are now looking to push forward this one-night idea.

                        <p>Retro 1010! is a Tetris-like game, inspired by the quite famous "1010!".
                           You need to place pieces of diferent sizes and shapes on a 10 by 10 board,
                           and try to always have enough places to do so.
                           You earn points when placing a piece, or supressing a line by filling up an entire row or column.
                           I did this game during my free time in high school and spent a good amount of time developing alone all parts of the game,
                           including the sound system and the texture design.</p>
